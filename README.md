Experimentation with Regression techniques

RSomeimes back I and my friend Rohit participated in a Kaggle Competition. The objective of the project was to use advanced Regression techniques to predict house prices. Here is my code for data prep and model building.HSD1 is the daat prep file and HSD3 is the code file.

I have shown implimentation of Ridge, Lasso, Generalized Additive Models, WLS, and Bossting (XGBOOST) in R.
